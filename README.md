# Mc "Wii Edition"
## READ THIS BEFORE COMPLAINING
This is only a forge mod for Minecraft. Not an actual Wii Edition. \
This is called Wii Edition because if built/configured properly it will play Wii songs and display custom text on the main screen. \
This is meant exclusively as a joke, please do not take this serious.

## Configuration
You need to add the songs manually because of copyright reasons.
```
src/main/resources/miichannel.ogg
src/main/resources/wiishoptheme.ogg
src/main/resources/wiisportsresort.ogg
```
Must be .ogg files.

## Building
Please look at the `Configuration` step first, and once you have done it, you are ready to run \
Linux: `./gradlew build` \
Windows: `gradlew build` \
to produce a jar file in `build\libs` which is a forge mod for 1.12.2
